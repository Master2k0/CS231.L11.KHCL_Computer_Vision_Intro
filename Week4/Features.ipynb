    "- An interest point (key point, salient point) detector is an algorithm that chooses points from an image based on some criterion. Typically, an interest point is a local maximum of some function, such as a \"cornerness\" metric.\n",
    "- A descriptor is a vector of values, which somehow describes the image patch around an interest point. It could be as simple as the raw pixel values, or it could be more complicated, such as a histogram of gradient orientations."
